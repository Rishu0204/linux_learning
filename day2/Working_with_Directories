Working With Directories

	Directories are simply containers for files and other directories. They provide a tree like structure for organizing the system.

. :- Current directory.
.. :- Parent directory.
/ :- Directory separator.

	We can use cd command to navigate through the directories.
example: 
	cd /var/tmp
	cd /home/gitrepo/linux
	cd .. :- Takes you to parent directory.

Creating And Removing Directories

mkdir [-p] directory :- Create a directory. Use the -p (parents) option to create intermediate directories.

example:
	mkdir newdir :- Creates a new directory named newdir
	mkdir -p newdir/product/reviews :- Creates three directory newdir -> pro	duct -> reviews.

rmdir directory :- Removes empty directory.
rmdir -rf directory :- Removes directory recursively.

example:
	rmdir reviews :- Removes directory reviwes
	rm -rf newdir :- Removes directory newdir and everything in it.
